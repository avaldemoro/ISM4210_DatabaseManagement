ISM4210 (Database Management)

## About
This repository is dedicated to providing the solutions for the assignments to ISM4210 Spring 2016 at the University of Florida. In the first half of this course, we had learned how to use an Entity-Relation (ER) model to represent data structure of a business organization, and to learn the basic concepts of database management, such as entity, relation, attributes, etc. We had also learned Enhanced Entity-Relation (EER) models, as well as the structure of relational model and how to transform an EER model to a relational model (as well as the process of normalization to satisfy integrity constraints and reduce data redundancy). <br>
In the second half of the class, we learned how to use MySQL and conduct queries to apply what we learned in the first half of the class. 
## Individual Projects Overview
<br>[Database Design Language](IP3/IP3_SQLDDL.sql)
<br>[<b>Description</b>](IP3/ISM4210_IP3.pdf)
<b>Summary: </b> In this assignment, we created a database for the Hippodrome (a local Gainesville theater) in mySQL. We are using CREATE and ALTER statements to make our tables, and finally using the SELECT and DESC statement to show what is populated within our tables.

[Single Table Queries](IP4/IP4_SingleTableQueries.sql)
<br>[<b>Description</b>](IP4/ISM4210_IP4.pdf)
<br><b>Summary: </b> In this assignment, we wrote single table queries to use the data in the [Hippodrome database](TheHipp.sql). The queries we wrote are listed in the description.

[Multiple Table Queries](IP5/IP5Code.sql)
<br>[<b>Description</b>](IP5/ISM4210_IP5.pdf)
<br><b>Summary: </b> In this assignment, we wrote multiple table queries to use the data in the [Hippodrome database](TheHipp.sql). The queries we wrote are listed in the description.
